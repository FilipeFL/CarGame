# The Folders / As Pastas

EN.: 
    The folder named "Game" includes the executable game file that was builded for Windows;
    The folder named "Scripts" have only the scripts that I made for this project;
    The folder named "Unity Project" have the hole project to manipulate with Unity Engine;
PT.:
    A pasta "Game" tem o aplicativo executável do jogo;
    A pasta "Scripts" contém apenas os códigos feitos na produção do jogo;
    A pasta "Unity Project" possui todo o projeto;

# Note: The name of some variables in the scripts may be in portuguese sometimes or english, I'll probably fix this issue in the future ;)
